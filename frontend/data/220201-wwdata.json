			"Job Summary:": "About Us \n\nAMLB is a non-traditional virtual Chief Financial Officer (CFO) firm that enables clients and colleagues to reach their potential. Launched just over a year ago, AMLB is growing quickly, having onboarded a portfolio of clients making a real impact in a range of industries from ecommerce to not-for-profit. We act as strategic financial partners that really get to know our clients' businesses, are relationship-focused rather than transactional, and have built a reputation for delivering proactive advice that unleashes our clients' performance potential. \n\n \n\nwww.amlb.ca \n\n  \n\nHow we're different \n\nWhat does non-traditional mean? We don't work from a physical office; our clients are from across Canada and we're there for them when they need us, virtually. We deploy cloud-based technologies together with automation as game-changers for our clients and our firm. And we're completely paperless. This allows our people to pursue careers in a 100% virtual and results-based practice that focuses on value-added work. You will never spend time manually entering bank and credit card transactions! It also means we do not use hours worked to measure performance. Instead, we've established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure impact. Examples of our KPIs are: deliverable time and quality, responsiveness to clients and client satisfaction scores. \n\n \n\nWe view each team member as having the potential to make a real difference not only for our clients but for each other and the success of our firm. That is why, for each employee, we invest in industry leading tools and training programs, provide a high level of autonomy, encourage the pursuit of initiatives to improve the way we work and provide a coach for one-on-one support from day one to foster development. \n\n \n\nOne of AMLB's core values is inclusive collaboration, which means we believe in seeking out different perspectives than our own to make all of us better colleagues and partners. We are signatories to Canada's 50 - 30 Challenge as well as the BlackNorth Initiative, which together demonstrate our commitment to gender parity and under-represented groups. This is part of our DNA. \n\n \n\nThe role: \n\nAs a Business Analyst - Process and Applications, you will play a key role in developing and implementing AMLB's firm-wide process development and improvement framework while also leading strategic initiatives to grow and improve the firm. You would work remotely but also closely with AMLB's co-founders (former Fortune 500 executives) who prioritize learning, a collaborative culture and provide mentorship along the way. If you want to work at an entrepreneurial firm where you will have the opportunity to make a real impact and gain experience using tools that are changing the age-old way accounting is done, you may be a great fit for AMLB. \n\n \n\nOpen to applicants with 8 month work terms requirements as well.",

My peers at BioPed established a welcoming and supportive environment. From shadowing the Pedorthic team, I observed clinical procedures and made connections that enhanced the concepts taught from my undergraduate studies. My involvement within the orthotics assembly process, as well as patient assessments, facilitated my growth as a Co-op student. BioPed provided an excellent opportunity to develop the fundamental experiences of a health care provider.\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t-Shawn Budiatmanto, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Fall 2020\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\"My experience at BioPed was absolutely amazing. I was given the opportunity to learn about Pedorthics and Chiropody, two career paths I was unaware of prior to working there. I was a little nervous when starting as it was my first work term, however the staff at BioPed were very friendly and welcomed me in with open arms. I learned so much about lower limb injuries and treatments, bracing options, and even how to work with vendors and insurance companies throughout the work term. I would highly recommend working at BioPed if given the chance!\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t- Makayla Fraser, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Winter 2021\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\"Prior to this work term, I had never been exposed to the field of Pedorthics and Chiropody and was quite unfamiliar with what these professions have to offer. Working at Bioped has now opened an entirely new perspective of healthcare which I did not consider before. Throughout my time here, I have been able to see and experience first-hand all the hard work that is put in to provide patients with nothing but the most effective solutions to address their problems and concerns. Whether it was through fabrication of orthotics, sitting in on assessments or dealing with customer retail, each day brought a new experience to learn from, which piqued my interest and kept me engaged. Overall, this work term has been a memorable experience working with such a dynamic and innovative team, who all have positively influenced my growth as a kinesiology student.\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t-Imaan Ahmed, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Spring 2021",

My peers at BioPed established a welcoming and supportive environment. From shadowing the Pedorthic team, I observed clinical procedures and made connections that enhanced the concepts taught from my undergraduate studies. My involvement within the orthotics assembly process, as well as patient assessments, facilitated my growth as a Co-op student. BioPed provided an excellent opportunity to develop the fundamental experiences of a health care provider.\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t-Shawn Budiatmanto, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Fall 2020\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\"My experience at BioPed was absolutely amazing. I was given the opportunity to learn about Pedorthics and Chiropody, two career paths I was unaware of prior to working there. I was a little nervous when starting as it was my first work term, however the staff at BioPed were very friendly and welcomed me in with open arms. I learned so much about lower limb injuries and treatments, bracing options, and even how to work with vendors and insurance companies throughout the work term. I would highly recommend working at BioPed if given the chance!\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t- Makayla Fraser, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Winter 2021\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\"Prior to this work term, I had never been exposed to the field of Pedorthics and Chiropody and was quite unfamiliar with what these professions have to offer. Working at Bioped has now opened an entirely new perspective of healthcare which I did not consider before. Throughout my time here, I have been able to see and experience first-hand all the hard work that is put in to provide patients with nothing but the most effective solutions to address their problems and concerns. Whether it was through fabrication of orthotics, sitting in on assessments or dealing with customer retail, each day brought a new experience to learn from, which piqued my interest and kept me engaged. Overall, this work term has been a memorable experience working with such a dynamic and innovative team, who all have positively influenced my growth as a kinesiology student.\"\n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t-Imaan Ahmed, University of Waterloo Kinesiology Co-op Student, Spring 2021",
